Problem: Analyze the given schedule of transactions for conflict-serializability.

Steps to Solve:

1. Identify Transactions and Operations:
   - List each transaction and their operations (Read - R, Write - W, Commit - COM) on the data items.
   - In this problem:
     - T1: R(A), R(C), W(B), COM
     - T2: R(A), W(A), COM
     - T3: R(A), R(C), W(B), COM

2. Check for Conflicting Operations:
   - Conflicts occur when two transactions access the same data item, and at least one of the operations is a Write.
   - Types of conflicts:
     - Write-Read (W-R): One transaction writes a data item that another transaction reads.
     - Read-Write (R-W): One transaction reads a data item that another transaction writes.
     - Write-Write (W-W): Two transactions write to the same data item.
   - Find all conflicts:
     - Between T1 and T2: R(A) in T1 and W(A) in T2 (R-W conflict).
     - Between T1 and T3: W(B) in T1 and W(B) in T3 (W-W conflict).
     - Between T2 and T3: W(A) in T2 and R(A) in T3 (W-R conflict).

3. Draw the Conflict Serialization Graph:
   - Create a node for each transaction (T1, T2, T3).
   - Draw directed edges based on conflicts:
     - From T1 to T2 due to R(A) in T1 and W(A) in T2.
     - From T1 to T3 due to W(B) in T1 and W(B) in T3.
     - From T2 to T3 due to W(A) in T2 and R(A) in T3.

4. Check for Cycles in the Graph:
   - If the graph has no cycles, the schedule is conflict-serializable.
   - If there are cycles, the schedule is not conflict-serializable.
   - In this problem, the graph is acyclic, so the schedule is conflict-serializable.

Summary:
- Nodes: T1, T2, T3
- Edges:
   - T1 → T2
   - T1 → T3
   - T2 → T3
- Result: The schedule is conflict-serializable because the graph has no cycles.
